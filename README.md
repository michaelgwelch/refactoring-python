# Refactoring 2nd Edition in Python

This repository contains a python version of the theater project
as described in chapter 1 of Martin Fowler's Refactoring 2nd Edition book.

As the author states (*emphasis mine*):

> Outside of the example sections, I'm not making any assumptions about the language. I expect the reader to absorb my general comments and apply them to the language they are using. *Indeed, I expect readers to take the JavaScript examples and adapt them to their language.*
